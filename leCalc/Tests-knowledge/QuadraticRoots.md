#  Quadratic roots

based on quadratic formula, we are able to find several data about polynom/function/equation. 

## Equation
Most important is equation = 0 >> we can get 2, 1 or non roots in real Numbers 
### Discriminant

(-b +/- sqrt(b^2 -4ac)) / 2a

## polynoms/functions 
We can be interested in maximum, minimum, crossing axis.

### x = 0 >> crosing y axis 

### y = 0 >> roots of equation crossing x axis

### Vertex

### Focus
