#  Quadratic roots

based on quadratic formula, we are able to find several data about polynom/function/equation. 

Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0

## Equation
Most important is equation = 0 >> we can get 2, 1 or non roots in real Numbers 

### Discriminant
D = b^2 - 4ac

### roots
D > 0 : two roots
D = 0 : one root
D < 0 : no roots in Rel / roots in complex numbers

(-b +/- sqrt(D)) / 2a

## polynoms/functions 
We can be interested in maximum, minimum, crossing axis.

### crossing y axis: 
x = 0 >> crosing y axis constant C()

### crossing x axis:
roots of quadratic equation 
y = 0 >> roots of equation crossing x axis

### Vertex
V[x,y] = [-b/2a; (4ac-b^2)/4a]

("["x^2-4=0", "x_{1}=2", "x_{2}=-2", "[x,y]=[0,-4]", "V[x,y]=[0,-4]"]") is not equal to 
("["x^2+4=0", "x_{1}=2", "x_{2}=-2", "[x,y]=[0,-4]", "V[x,y]=[0,-4]"]")
