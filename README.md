# LECalc
Leonhard Euler's calculator - just because I was thinking 

## Purpouse 
This code is meant to be part of my presentation of my skills as same as my space to grow my SwiftUI and relevant knowkledge. It is not meant to take other existing calculators away, yet.

#### TODOs: 

plan to implement:

- [ ] NiceToHave: graphs for functions 
- [ ] XCTests for all functions
- [x] RegExp for Roman numbers (school excercise + chatGPT help)
- [ ] NiceToHave: Way to write line above roman numbers to make more then 3999+ numbers 
- [ ] Add special font just for representating RomanNumbers 🟠 (solved by Bold, for now) 
- [ ] Work on macOS UI 
- [ ] Improve iOS UI
