# LECalc
Leonhard Euler's calculator - just because I was thinking 

## Purpouse 
This code is meant to be part of my presentation of my skills as same as my space to grow my SwiftUI and relevant knowkledge. It is not meant to take other existing calculators away, yet.

- [ ] prime numbers
- [ ] quadratic roots
- [ ] random numbers
- [ ] right triangle
- [ ] roll of the dice (statistics)
- [ ] roll of the dice (proability)
- [ ] roman numbers
- [ ] variations

widgets

#### TODOs: 

plan to implement: 
- [ ] darkMode adaptation
